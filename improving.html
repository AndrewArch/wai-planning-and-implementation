				<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
				<p>Organizations new to accessibility may find they lack the policies, processes, or skills required to support accessible websites. For example, procurement policies may not reference accessibility, staff may have low awareness of accessibility issues, or the best tools may not be available. Even without a comprehensive accessibility policy and support framework there are considerations that help make planning to improve accessibility more efficient and effective.</p>

				<h3>What is this document for?</h3>
					<p>This document outlines important steps and questions to consider when trying to improve the accessibility of your site. Note that this approach will help you towards a more accessible website, but without internal policies and processes you may find it difficult to keep your website accessible. The related document on <a href="Overview">Implementation Planning</a> may be useful if you are considering a more strategic approach to accessibility.</p>

				<h3>Using this document</h3>
					<p>There are some key steps you will need to plan for. Each step is described and includes important points for you to consider.</p>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


				<h2 id="scope">Determine Scope and Target</h2>
				<p>Scope is the range of web content you are aiming to review and improve. This could be a complete website or a subsection of pages. Target is the accessibility standard you aim to evaluate against and conform to.</p>
				<p>The initial pressures for your project will likely influence your scope and target. For example, if customer feedback highlighted an accessibility barrier that prevents use, then that provides your initial scope. If you are legally required to meet a certain level of accessibility, then your target will be at least that level.</p>
				<p>Your scope may be confined to a specific barrier. Even with restricted scope you might take the opportunity to fix other issues in related areas of the website. For example, while fixing contrast in the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> you might also fix other issues that only require changes to the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
				<p>A legal imperative may require each page on your website to be in scope. If you have limited resources then there is the opportunity to define different compliance dates for different areas of the website or conformance levels.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Set a standard and conformance level.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Most organizations use <a href="/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr></a> as a target for accessibility and specify what level of success criteria they aim to meet, Level A, AA, or AAA. Conformance levels broadly indicate increasingly more inclusive websites with fewer barriers. Your organization may already have an accessibility policy specifying what standard and level you need to achieve.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Define what is to be evaluated.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Your project may be a single website or a part of a larger site. You will need to carefully consider your timescales and available resources when determining the scope. Where you initially have limited resources focusing on key user journeys and pages may bring the most significant benefits.</p>

			  <h2 id="assess">Assess the Situation</h2>
				<p>The goal of assessing your website is to identify accessibility barriers and gather information to plan for their repair. Your target will define what you need to evaluate against, although it is sometimes worth evaluating to a higher level. There are likely some higher level criteria that you already meet or are easily achieved.</p>
				<p>Rather than thoroughly evaluating every target page, you can focus on repeated areas in order to obtain more valuable information with less effort. For example, templates, style sheets, and any shared components, such as navigation bars and footers, only need to be evaluated once.</p>
				<p>Knowing the cause of issues can help in your planning. For example, if only a few data tables are missing necessary markup, then you might include adding table markup to quality assurance processes. However, if none of the tables are properly marked up, you would consider additional training on data table markup. If tables from one development team are done properly, but another teams are not, this helps clarify where training is needed.</p>
				<p>Many organizations hire accessibility specialists to evaluate their website. They will also be able to provide guidance on how to respond to the identified barriers. This can include general recommendations on approach and priorities, specific recommendations on solutions, and guidance on the knowledge and skills needed for the repairs.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Before assessing, fix any known barriers.</span>
						<div>
							<p>In some cases you may already know of accessibility barriers. If easily fixed, it may be best to repair these before going further. This can bring early site improvement. More importantly, if you are involving users in your evaluation, known existing barriers may make it difficult to obtain feedback on other areas.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate using a standardized approach.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Ensure that you are consistent in applying your evaluation methodology. This allows you to repeat the evaluation and compare the results. <abbr title="Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology">WCAG-EM</abbr> is a comprehensive and structured approach to help determine how well a website conforms to <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Evaluate with real users.</span>
						<div>
							<p>In addition to helping identify and prioritize accessibility barriers, watching people struggle to use your site can be a powerful motivator for your project team.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Use appropriate evaluation and repair tools.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Web accessibility evaluation tools are programs and online services that help check if a website meets accessibility guidelines. There are also tools that help repair accessibility barriers. Some evaluation tools can be configured to be more useful to your specific project. For example, once you figure out your scope and target, you can configure the tool to only evaluate those criteria and pages. This can speed up the evaluation and simplify the report.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Consider how authoring tools might introduce barriers.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Authoring tools are software or services used to create or modify websites, such as web page editors and content management systems (CMS). Some authoring tools provide better accessibility support than others. You might be able to improve accessibility support in your authoring tool by:</p>
							<ul>
						    <li>Configuring your tools. For example, sometimes accessibility features in authoring tools are disabled by default and need to be turned on.</li>
						    <li>Using plug-ins or other add-on software to extend the accessibility support of your tools.</li>
						    <li>Upgrading your existing tools to the latest version, if they have better accessibility support.</li>
						    <li>Purchasing different tools with better accessibility support.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>For some content, such as video or <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, there may be an involved creation process with a number of tools involved. Consider each step of the process to identify where issues are introduced and where they may be best addressed.</p>
						</div>
					</li>

			  <h2 id="prioritize">Prioritize Solutions</h2>
				<p>When faced with limited resources or a need to respond quickly to issues, you will need to prioritize your repairs. There are two important factors to determine:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><h4>What is the impact on people with disabilities?</h4>
						<p>Accessibility barriers are often identified by WCAG success criteria. Each criteria has a Level (A, AA, AAA) that helps determine the impact of a particular accessibility barrier. The actual impact depends on the context of the barrier and target audience. For example, poor contrast in the main content has a high impact, whereas in generic footers it may have low impact.</p>
						<p>Evaluating with users will also help determine the impact of accessibility any barriers.</p>
					</li>
					<li><h4>What is the effort required for repair?</h4>
						<p>The time, cost, and skills to fix an issue will vary greatly. For example, repairing an issue in the footer could require a simple change to a template that is automatically propagated throughout the website, or it could require changing every page manually.</p>
						<p>Running workshops with representatives from all teams can help you quickly determine possible solutions and what effort would be required to implement them. Ensure that whoever is responsible for implementing the solution is part of any discussion, as they will know best what constraints exist.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Prioritize by barrier.</span>
						<div>
							<p>You will generally want to prioritize high impact easy fixes first. This provides the most improvement in the shortest time. Creating a graph of impact versus effort can help you quickly determine the priority of barriers. This approach usually takes less time. However, it may result in harder to fix issues always falling out of scope.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Prioritize by area.</span>
						<div>
							<p>It is usually best to first repair those areas that have the greatest impact on user experience. Identify key pages or journeys within the website and fix problems in those areas. For example, the home page may be a primary entry point, or purchasing a product and payment process may be important functions. Frequently-used, high-traffic, pages and functionality can be identified using analytics.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Related resources</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/WAI/intro/people-use-web/Overview">How People with Disabilities Use the Web</a> - Provides examples of how people with disabilities use the web, which can be helpful when prioritizing issues.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			  <h2 id="repair">Implement Repairs</h2>
				<p>Implementing repairs is where the majority of project time will go. Once issues are prioritized, you will be able to plan how long it will take to fix them based on the effort. This gives a clear indication of what is achievable given the project resources available.</p>
				<p>The brunt of repairs often fall to developers to address but some issues, such as content or issues with process, will be better handled by others. For example, where link text in primary content is unclear, whoever manages your content can address this. For each issue to be addressed ensure that it is clear who is to undertake the work and that they have the appropriate skills or knowledge. This may identify areas where additional training is required.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Review solutions following implementation.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Sometimes there is no perfect solution or there is uncertainty as to whether a solution might introduce other problems. Running an evaluation of the repairs is vital to ensure that the issue has been adequately addressed. This can lead to an ongoing cycle of test and repair which you will need to manage appropriately.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Keep track of solutions.</span>
						<div>
							<p>It is useful to document what solutions were considered and finally implemented. This helps subsequent projects avoid introducing the same issues, or attempting solutions already shown to be flawed. For less experienced and new team members this can be a helpful resource in understanding more about accessibility in your organization.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Consider production processes and training.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Sometimes issues occur because of lack of knowledge or problems in the content production process. After fixing immediate problems, consider how to ensure they don't reoccur. This can take the form of training key staff or changing processes to introduce appropriate quality assurance checks.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			  <h2 id="review">Review Achievements</h2>
				<p>Once repairs are completed, review what has been achieved and what is still left to do. Knowing what problems still exist will help with planning ongoing maintenance. Communicating known issues to your site visitors might be helpful, especially when you are able to provide suitable alternatives.</p>
				<p>Continue to evaluate accessibility in updated pages to ensure that new barriers are not introduced. This may require new or improved quality assurance stages in your web content production process. See the <a href="/WAI/eval/considerations#ongoing">Ongoing monitoring</a> section of the Evaluation Approaches for Specific Contexts document.</p>

				<h3>Key actions</h3>
				<ul class="key-actions">
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Document any remaining issues.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Knowing what was fixed, how, and what outstanding issues remain can help subsequent maintenance or redesign activities. This will also help maintain momentum for accessibility and reduce subsequent evaluation costs.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Update or create your accessibility conformance statement.</span>
						<div>
							<p>Your accessibility statement can provide contact details for feedback, outline your commitment to accessibility, and provide information to help users optimize their experience. You might also want to summarize how your site is supportive of accessibility, and where you still have work to do. Following completion of any accessibility repairs it is important to review your accessibility statement and update it with improvements made and remaining issues.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li><span class="f_panelHead">Set a follow-up date.</span>
						<div>
							<p>It is important that the accessibility of your website is regularly reviewed. At the end of your project set a date for when the accessibility of the website should be next reviewed. This may be part of a regular maintenance schedule or as part of an upcoming improvement or redesign project. This can be recorded in your accessibility statement or policy.</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>

			  <h2 id="strategic">Next steps: Strategic Planning</h2>
				<p>Thinking about accessibility tactically will generally be less cost effective and efficient that considering it as an integral part of your web development strategy. There are several things you can do to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard.</p>
				
				<ul>
			    <li><a href="/WAI/impl/Overview">Implementing Web Accessibility Across Organizations and Projects</a> outlines how to integrate accessibility throughout your web development. Ensure that when redesigns or updates are planned, accessibility is included from the start of the project. Accessibility is much less costly and time-consuming when tackled at the beginning of a project, rather than the end.</li>
			    <li>Ensure that you have an effective accessibility policy in place that specifies that your website meet or exceed legal requirements.</li>
					<ul>
