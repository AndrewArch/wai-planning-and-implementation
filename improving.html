<h2><a name="intro" id="intro" shape="rect">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>Most organizations already have a website, and most of those sites were
developed without considering accessibility. Thus most websites today have
accessibility barriers that make it difficult or impossible for some people
with disabilities to use the site. Some sites have several significant
barriers; others have only a few minor barriers. Sites developed to meet
 web standards such as <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> usually have fewer barriers.</p>

  <p>
 While implementing accessibility on an existing website may seem
overwhelming at first, there are  approaches to make the process
more efficient and effective. This document provides guidance for fixing accessibility barriers in
existing websites; in other words, repairing accessibility problems, or
retrofitting a site to improve accessibility. It provides approaches and tips
for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Getting started understanding the issues, and communicating your
    commitment to improve the accessibility of your site</li>  <li>Developing a retrofitting plan by identifying accessibility barriers
    and prioritizing repairs</li>  <li>Repairing accessibility barriers on your site efficiently and
    effectively</li>
  <li>Addressing next steps after initial retrofitting</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/Overview.html" shape="rect">Implementation Planning
for Web Accessibility</a> is a related document that provides additional
relevant information. It is primarily for organizations just starting web
accessibility with a new site. Many of the issues addressed in that document
apply to retrofitting an existing site as well.</p>

<h2><a name="start" id="start" shape="rect">Getting Started</a></h2>

<h3>Understanding the Basics</h3>

<p>A first step in retrofitting your site is understanding the basics of web
accessibility.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility" shape="rect">W3C - Accessibility</a> briefly introduces web accessibility and links to
    additional resources.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php" shape="rect">Essential
    Components of Web Accessibility</a> shows how web accessibility depends
    on several components of web development and interaction working together
    and shows the relationship between the WAI guidelines: Web Content
    Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="../intro/wcag.php" shape="rect">WCAG</a>), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="../intro/atag.php" shape="rect">ATAG</a>), and User Agent
    Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="../intro/uaag.php" shape="rect">UAAG</a>).</li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/people-use-web" shape="rect">How People with Disabilities Use the
    Web</a> describes how different disabilities affect web use and
    accessibility requirements for people with different kinds of
    disabilities, and includes scenarios of people with disabilities using
    the Web.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a rough idea of the type and amount of accessibility barriers on
your website, you can do some initial evaluation.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary.html" shape="rect">Preliminary
    Review</a> of Websites for Accessibility describes an approach to
    quickly identify some potential accessibility barriers on a website.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/users.html" shape="rect">Involving Users in Web
    Accessibility Evaluation</a> provides guidance on including people with
    disabilities ("users") in accessibility evaluation throughout web
    development. In addition to helping identify and prioritize accessibility barriers,
    watching people struggle to use your site can be a powerful motivator for
    your retrofitting project team.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting the Target</h3>

<p>Many organizations use <a href="/WAI/intro/wcag.php" shape="rect">WCAG</a>
as a target for accessibility. For example, an organization sets its target
to meet WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA success criteria.</p>

<p>The motivations and pressures for your retrofitting project will likely
influence your target. For example, if customers told you about an
accessibility barrier that prevents them from using your external website,
you probably want to fix that first. If you are legally required to meet a
certain level of accessibility in your internal website ("intranet"), your
target will be at least that level.</p>
  <p>In some retrofitting situations, organizations define a multi-tiered
target with different dates for different levels: 
            For example, meet WCAG 2.0 Level A success criteria in key
web pages within 2 months, and meet Level AA success criteria  in all pages
within 9 months.</p>

  <p>Developing an accessibility policy is a good way to clarify and
communicate your target.
Note that developing and adopting policies can take a while, and retrofitting need not
wait for an official policy. The <a href="#next" shape="rect">Addressing Next Steps</a> section below provides links
to information on legal requirements and organizational policies.</p>

<h3>Communicating the Status of Your Retrofitting Project</h3>

<p>Once you have determined that there are accessibility barriers on your website that you are fixing, communicate that to your users, for example,
through an accessibility statement. An accessibility statement can
include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A brief description of the major accessibility barriers on your site,
    so that users with disabilities know what to expect</li>  <li>A statement of your commitment to fix the accessibility barriers on
    your website</li>
</ul>

  <p>Make links to the accessibility statement easy to find; for example, put
it as the first link in your home page markup (code). If some parts of
    your site are inaccessible, provide alternative ways for users to get the
    information or interaction; for example, contact phone numbers and
    mailing addresses. </p>

<h2><a name="eval" id="eval" shape="rect">Evaluating to Identify the Issues</a></h2>

<p>It is usually most efficient to first identify all of the accessibility
barriers on your site. However, if you have a few serious accessibility
barriers that are fairly easy to repair, it may be best to repair those right
away before going further.</p>

  <p>
 The goal of evaluating before retrofitting is to define the accessibility
barriers on your site and gather  information to plan an efficient
retrofitting project. Rather than  thoroughly evaluating every page on your
site, you can focus  on representative areas in order to get
more valuable information with less effort. For example, templates, style
sheets, and any elements that are the same across pages, such as navigation
bars and footers, only need to be evaluated once and can then be skipped on
pages where they are repeated. The  areas listed in the <a href="#area" shape="rect">Prioritizing by Area</a> section below also apply to focusing
evaluation. Ensure that your evaluation covers each feature and functionality (for
example, data tables, forms, scripts)  from each developer or development
group. </p>
  <p>Evaluation can focus on specific points to help guide your retrofitting
plan, such as determining if  a particular accessibility barrier is
widespread or isolated. For example, if only a few of your data tables are missing necessary markup, your
retrofitting plan would include adding table markup to quality assurance
(QA) processes. However, if none of the tables are
properly marked up, you would add data table markup  to your education plan. If  tables from one development group are done properly
but from another development group are not, this further clarifies
where education is needed.

</p>
<p>The following resources help evaluate a website for accessibility
barriers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/" shape="rect">How to Meet WCAG 2.0: 
     A customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements (success criteria) and techniques</a> can be used as a checklist</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/conformance" shape="rect">Conformance Evaluation
     of Websites for Accessibility</a> describes an approach for determining
     if a website meets accessibility standards, including using evaluation
     tools and manually evaluating pages.</li>
  <li><a href="/WAI/eval/reviewteams" shape="rect">Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility</a>
    describes  recommended expertise and considerations for effective
    collaboration to evaluate web accessibility.</li>
  <li>See also <a href="#ertools" shape="rect">Evaluation and Repair Tools</a> below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many organizations hire accessibility specialists to evaluate their website. Accessibility specialists can also provide guidance on retrofitting
your site, including general recommendations on approach and priorities, 
specific recommendations for repairing each barrier identified, and guidance
on the knowledge and skills needed for the repairs.</p>

<h2><a name="retro" id="retro" shape="rect">Optimizing Your Retrofitting</a></h2>
  <p>The following  tips on knowledge and skills, processes, and tools help optimize  retrofitting; that is, make it more efficient.</p>

<h3><a name="skills" id="skills" shape="rect">Optimizing Knowledge and Skills</a></h3>  <p>
Depending on your project staff and the type of accessibility barriers on
your site, you might need to acquire additional knowledge and skills in order
to repair your site. At a minimum, those involved in web development will
need to understand how to fix the accessibility barriers on your site,  as well as how to avoid introducing new barriers.</p>

  <p class="listintro">
 It is often best to combine educating existing staff with bringing in
outside expertise, either hiring additional staff or engaging consultants. A
qualified accessibility expert can save time and effort in the long run by
providing:</p>
<ul class="listafterpul">
    <li>The latest best practices for accessibility solutions</li>
    <li>First-hand experience of how people with disabilities interact with the
    Web</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to accessibility expertise, you may need other web development
skills. The <a href="/WAI/eval/reviewteams" shape="rect">Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility</a> document lists skills needed to evaluate web accessibility,
which are similar to the skills needed for repair.</p>

<h3><a name="tools" id="tools" shape="rect">Optimizing Processes</a></h3>

<h4><strong>Distributing tasks</strong></h4>

<p>Accessibility repairs can be distributed among different people based on
their skills and other factors. For example, making link text clear requires
some knowledge of the content and usually only minor skills with the
authoring tool. Whereas repairing scripts that generate dynamic content
requires programming skills. By distributing tasks effectively, you can get
more barriers fixed faster with less effort.</p>

<h4>Clarifying requirements</h4>

<p>One of the causes of accessibility barriers is that those in web
development did not know that they should make the website accessible. To
avoid this problem in your retrofitting project, ensure that everyone knows
that accessibility is a requirement, even if you do not yet have an official
policy. Include accessibility in development guidelines, quality assurance
processes, project sign-offs, etc.</p>

<h4><strong>Validating solutions before implementing them</strong></h4>

<p>Retrofitting projects typically involve identifying a barrier, developing
a solution to the barrier, and implementing that solution throughout the website.  Before you implement an accessibility solution, validate that it is
effective.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/involving" shape="rect">Involving users
with disabilities</a> and having accessibility specialists evaluate your
planned repairs can catch any problems before they are propagated throughout
your site.</p>

<h3>Optimizing Tools</h3>

<p>Which authoring tools and evaluation tools you use and how they are
configured can impact your retrofitting efforts, as explained below.</p>

<h4>Authoring Tools</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php" shape="rect">Authoring tools</a> are
software or services used to create or modify websites, such as web page
editors and content management systems (CMS). Some authoring tools provide
better accessibility support than others. Thus, your authoring tool can help
or hinder your retrofitting efforts. The document <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/components.php" shape="rect">Essential Components of Web
Accessibility</a> describes the role of authoring tools and the effect of
insufficient support for accessibility.</p>

<p class="listintro">You might be able to improve accessibility support in your authoring tool
by:</p>
<ul class="listafterpul">
  <li>Configuring your tools, for example, sometimes accessibility features
    in authoring tools are disabled by default and need to be turned on</li>
  <li>Using plug-ins or other add-on software to extend the accessibility
    support of your tools</li>
  <li>Upgrading your existing tools to the latest version, if they have
    better accessibility support</li>
  <li>Purchasing different tools with better accessibility support</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/software" shape="rect">Selecting and Using
Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility</a> document includes questions to ask
software vendors regarding accessibility support in current and upcoming
versions.</p>

<h4><a name="ertools" id="ertools" shape="rect">Evaluation and Repair Tools</a></h4>

<p>Web accessibility evaluation tools are software programs and online
services that help determine if a website meets accessibility guidelines.
There are also tools that help repair accessibility barriers. Some repair
functions are built into evaluation tools, and some tools focus only on
repair, such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy" shape="rect">HTML Tidy</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools" shape="rect">Selecting Web
    Accessibility Evaluation Tools</a> provides guidance on choosing tools
    based on parameters such as your development environment, and the tool
    functionality.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html" shape="rect">Web Accessibility
    Evaluation Tools</a> is a  database of  over 100 tools that can be
    searched by different tool features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some evaluation tools can be configured to be more useful to your specific
project. For example, once you figure out which accessibility barriers you
are going to address on which pages, you can configure the tool to only
evaluate those barriers and pages. This speeds up the evaluation and
simplifies the report.</p>

<h2><a name="prior" id="prior" shape="rect">Prioritizing the Repairs</a></h2>

<p>Most sites developed without consideration for accessibility and other web
standards have many accessibility barriers that need to be repaired.
Prioritizing by barrier and by area, as explained below, makes the project
more manageable and ensures that the more important repairs get done
first.</p>

<h3>Prioritizing by Barriers</h3>

<p>One approach to retrofitting is to fix all of the Level A barriers
first, and then fix lower level barriers later. There are several
disadvantages to this approach: you have to go back over templates, style
sheets, and pages multiple times;  you will miss  easy-to-do, lower priority
items; and you can get hung up on a few hard problems, instead of  getting
lots of easy things done quickly.</p>

<p>A more effective approach in most cases is to do all of the high impact
<em>and</em> easy repairs while you are working on a page, template, style
sheet, etc. Then address harder problems later. This approach has several
advantages: it  usually takes less time overall, and  you get lots of changes
done quickly. This helps demonstrate your commitment to improving the
accessibility of your website as soon as is feasible.</p>

<p>To plan for retrofitting, consider two parameters for prioritizing the
order in which to address accessibility barriers: impact and effort. For each
accessibility barrier, determine:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Impact on people with disabilities.</strong> Accessibility
    barriers are often identified by <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php#whatis2" shape="rect">WCAG 2.0
success criteria</a>. Each success criteria has a Level (A, AA, AAA) that helps
    determine the impact of a particular accessibility barrier. The actual
    impact on users of a specific barrier depends on the context of your
    site. For example, poor color contrast in the main content has high impact on
    some people with disabilities, whereas in generic footers it may have low
    impact.<br clear="none" />
      
     <a href="../eval/users" shape="rect">Evaluating with users with disabilities</a> also
    helps determine the impact of accessibility barriers in your website.</li>
  <li><strong>Effort required for repair.</strong> The time, cost, and skills
    to repair a barrier varies greatly based on parameters such as the type
    of repair and your development environment.<br clear="none" />
    For example, repairing barriers in footers could require a simple change
    to the template that is automatically propagated throughout the website,
    or could require changing every page manually. Repairing missing
    alternative text equivalents requires knowing the content and
    understanding how the text is used; whereas, changing a site to
    effectively use style sheets requires CSS skills.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="area" id="area" shape="rect">Prioritizing by Area</a></h3>

<p class="listintro">Another aspect of prioritizing retrofitting is determining which areas to
work on first. It is usually best to first repair those areas that have the
greatest impact on users' experience with your website. Depending on how
your site is developed, you may be able to repair many barriers through:</p>
<ul class="listafterpul">
  <li>Templates that impact many pages</li>
  <li>Style sheets that impact many pages</li>
  <li>Elements that impact many pages, such as navigation bars and
  scripts</li>
</ul>

<p class="listintro">Certain pages may have higher priority, such as:</p>
<ul class="listafterpul">
  <li>The home page, which is often the first entry point to the site</li>
  <li>The main pages and functionality based on the purpose of the site,
    including
    <ul>
      <li>The path to get there from the common entry points</li>
      <li>The path to complete  transactions, such as ordering products</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frequently-used (high traffic) pages and functionality, including the
    path to get there and complete transactions</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="next" id="next" shape="rect">Next: Strategic Planning</a></h2>

  <p>After you have repaired the major accessibility barriers on your website,
there are several things you can do to help avoid creating new barriers and to continue
improving the accessibility of your site.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate accessibility throughout your web development. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/Overview.html" shape="rect">Implementation Plan for
    Web Accessibility</a>. Ensure that when redesigns or updates are planned,
    accessibility in included from the onset of the project. Accessibility is
    much less costly and time-consuming when implemented from the beginning
    of a project, rather than the end.</li>
  <li>Ensure that you have an effective accessibility policy in place that
    specifies that your website meet or exceed legal requirements.
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue to evaluate accessibility in updated pages to ensure that new
    barriers are not introduced. See the <a href="/WAI/eval/considerations#ongoing" shape="rect">Ongoing
