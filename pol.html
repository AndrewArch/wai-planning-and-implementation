		<h2><a name="intro" id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</a></h2>

		<p>An organizational policy on web accessibility sets out your goals for how your organization will support the creation of accessible websites and services. Creating a policy is a proactive step towards providing more inclusive services and an important component of corporate social responsibility. Making your policy public, or even widely distributed internally, increases the visibility of activities and ensures accessibility is prioritized.</p>
		
		<h3>Using your policy</h3>
		<p>An accessibility policy can be standalone or integrated into other policies concerned with organizational websites. For example policies associated with best practices for use of web standards, privacy, internationalization, or usability. Integrating into other general policies helps ensure that accessibility is approached as a core feature rather than an afterthought.</p>
		
		<h3>Maintaining your policy</h3>
		<p>Your policy is likely to reference particular standards or guidelines by version number, or make reference to particular legislation. It is important to ensure that you have mechanisms to review and update, or automatically update, your policies when the versions or legislation changes.</p>

		<h3>Using this document</h3>
		<p>This document outlines topics to consider when creating or updating an accessibility policy. Topics can be approached in any order and it is not necessary that a statement is provided to cover each topic. Your policy should be written in a way that is supportive not seen as a burden.The topics covered are:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#refer">Reference Guidelines and Standards</li>
			<li><a href="#scope">Define Scope of Policy</a></li>
			<li><a href="#miles">Set Milestones</a></li>
			<li><a href="#monit">Define Monitoring, Conformance Claims, and Follow-up Process</a></li>
		</ul>
		

		<h2 id="refer">Reference Guidelines and Standards</h2>
		<p>Recognized standards and guidelines define what websites and services need to achieve in order to be considered accessible. Ensuring that these are clearly referenced creates a shared understanding in your organization of your overall goals. Organizations wishing to require conformance to the latest version of the standards may specify conformance without specifying a version number.</p>
		<p><abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Guidelines categorize conformance criteria into levels; A, AA and AAA. The levels of conformance are based on a <a href="/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-levels-head">range of factors</a> but broadly indicate increasingly more inclusive websites with fewer barriers. Include an indication of the expected conformance level to be achieved. Consider that it may be difficult and expensive to set your initial goal too high if there has been little or no previous accessibility work.</p>
		<p>Authoring tools used to create websites can impact on the accessibility of the final product. They can also impact on staff with disabilities who have to use the tools as part of their job. Consider guidelines for your organization's content creation tools as an important part of your policy statement.</p>
		
		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Reference to latest version of web content standards or guideline.</li>
			<li>Conformance level to be achieved for each referenced guideline.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Reference to latest version of authoring tool standards or guidelines.</li>
			<li>Reference to any relevant legislative and regulatory requirements.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Relevant guidelines</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="/WAI/intro/wcag">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a></strong> - how to make websites accessible.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="/WAI/intro/atag">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</a></strong> - how to make software better support the production of accessible web content.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="/WAI/intro/uaag">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</a></strong> - how to make accessible browsers and multimedia players.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul class="with-drop-shadow">
			<li class="drop-shadow">This website aims to conform to <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <a href="/WAI/intro/wcag"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr></a> Level AA.</li>
			<li class="drop-shadow">At ACME Inc. we seek to ensure all our websites and web applications, both customer facing and for internal use, conform all Level A criteria of the <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <a href="/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> Version 2.0</a>. We also aim to ensure that our authoring tools conform to all Level A criteria of the <a href="/TR/ATAG20/"><abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> Version 2.0</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="scope">Define Scope of Policy</h2>
		<p>Your organizational policy should clearly identify what website content it applies to. Consider to what extent the policy applies to new, updated, and existing web pages. Where your organization has multiple websites the policy should make it clear which websites are addressed. The version of your policy for site visitors need not refer to all websites covered but should outline what is covered on the website they are viewing.</p>
		<p>The policy should specify to what extent it applies to web pages or components supplied by a third-party. Users may need access to primary and third-party content equally. Additional effort may be required to educate and establish compliance from third-party content developers.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify what websites, pages, and components the policy applies to.</li>
			<li>Specify how the policy relates to existing, updated, and new content.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider how the policy applies to third-party content and code providers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul class="with-drop-shadow">
			<li class="drop-shadow">This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing web pages.</li>
			<li class="drop-shadow">This policy applies to all web content produced or updated by ACME Inc. In addition, ACME Inc. is taking the	following steps to ensure accessibility of content provided by	third-party developers: 
				<ul>
					<li>Informing third-party developers of ACME Inc's	policy on web accessibility;</li>
					<li>Providing links to information and resources on implementing web accessibility;</li>
					<li>Providing the incentives to providers of <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0 Level AA conformant content.</li>
					<li>Monitoring and providing feedback on inaccessible third-party content.</li>
					<li>Seeking alternative third-party content providers where original providers continue to provide non-conformant content.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="miles">Set Milestones</h2>
		<p>Where the websites in scope are known to fall short of the specified policy it is important for accountability to define a date by which they will meet the policy. It also helps ensure that focus is maintained on the policy targets.</p>
		<p>When considering deadlines it is important to be realistic but also to ensure that issues are not left too long. In some cases it may be practical to phase in accessibility. First by rapidly addressing issues identified as absolute barriers. Then working on solutions to other identified issues as part of the next round of site improvements. This approach would need to be clearly outlined within your policy.</p>
		<p>For large websites it may be appropriate to prioritize based on important features or areas of the site. For example, the checkout process of an online store. It may also be appropriate to identify particular types of content, such as video, and specify when they will be accessible.</p>
		<p>Consider setting dates for establishing internal resources for training, technical assistance, monitoring, and/or an internal website with links to such resources.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify when the guidelines and standards in the policy will be met.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider whether a staged approach might fix absolute barriers more quickly.</li>
			<li>For large sites, consider prioritizing important features and functions.</li>
			<li>Consider dates for support tools and internal resources.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul class="with-drop-shadow">
			<li class="drop-shadow">By February 27, 2015, ACME Inc's websites will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level AA conformance.</li>
			<li class="drop-shadow">By November 7, 2014, ACME Inc's websites will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level A conformance; and by May 29, 2015 websites will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level AA conformance.</li>
			<li class="drop-shadow">By June 26, 2015, all vendors of authoring tools used by ACME Inc's should provide information regarding their plans for <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> 2.0 conformance in future versions of their software. By June 24, 2016 ACME Inc. will preferentially purchase <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> conformant authoring tools.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="monit">Define Monitoring, Conformance Claims, and Follow-up Process</h2>
		<p>Regardless of how the milestones are specified it is important to review progress to address known issues regularly. Any changes in timescale or milestones that have been met should be updated in the policy.</p>
		<p>There is also a need to specify a recommended process and schedule for reviewing websites in scope to ensure that the target level of accessibility is maintained. This could be defined as regular reviews of websites or incorporated into the web page publishing process.</p>
		<p>User feedback mechanisms are important to support users who might have difficulties with your site and to help gather information on barriers. Your policy should include information on what mechanisms are to be included and how feedback is to be handled and responded to.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify regular review period and process.</li>
			<li>Outline how visitor feedback will be captured, responded to, and used.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Define web page publishing workflow accessibility <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> process.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<ul class="with-drop-shadow">
			<li class="drop-shadow">All areas of the ACME Inc. website will be reviewed annually using the process described at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/">Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility</a>. Reviews are the responsibility of those departments identified as 'owning' that area of the site. All new content that is published will be subject to accessibility checks as part of the publishing workflow.</li>
			<li class="drop-shadow">Each page of the website will include links for feedback on the site; this information will be compiled and considered during the review process. Any submitted feedback will be responded to within 48 hours.</li>
		</ul>
