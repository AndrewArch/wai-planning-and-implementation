		<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>

		<p>Your web accessibility policy defines your goals for creating, managing, and delivering accessible websites. This includes the web content and applications provided as part of your website, as well as the tools used to create and to access your website. Your policy may apply to websites internal to the organization, such as intranets and extranets, and to websites for external audiences.</p>

		<h3>Designing a policy</h3>

		<p>Your web accessibility policy may be standalone or integrated into other policies, such as non-discrimination or equal opportunity policies. Ideally web accessibility should also be reflected in related documents, such as brand guidelines, coding standards, and project management frameworks. This helps accessibility to be considered as a core feature rather than an afterthought.</p>
		
		<p>Your organizational policy may be an internal document and not suitable for the public. To communicate your effort, consider providing a public accessibility statement that reflects your policy, goals, and achievements.</p>

		<p>To learn about how an organizational policy forms part of a broader approach to implementing accessibility, read <a href="Overview">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>Example of simple policy</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring that its website is accessible to people with disabilities. All the pages on our website will meet <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>'s <a href="/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> 2.0, Level AA conformance. Any issues should be reported to <a href="mailto:accessibility@acme.inc">accessibility@acme.inc</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="reference">Reference standards</h2>
		<p>The <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides a set of standards relevant to various aspects of web accessibility. Referencing these standards in policy documents ensures clear criteria for accessibility that are commonly recognized by governments and organizations from around the world.</p>

		<h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</h3>
		<p>Defines accessibility requirements for web content, including text, images, audio-visual materials, and the code used for structure, style, and interactions.</p>
		<p>WCAG is applicable for any organization with a website, including websites with mobile content and applications.</p>
		<p>Find out more at <a href="/WAI/intro/wcag">WCAG Overview</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</h3>
		<p>Authoring tools are software and services that are used to produce web content. Examples include HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), or online forums. ATAG guidelines outline both how to make the tools themselves accessible and also how the tools can be built to help create more accessible content.</p>
		<p>ATAG is applicable for websites that provide users the opportunity to generate content, such as adding comments, posting to forums, or uploading images or videos. If your organization provides tools, such as CMS's, for staff or customers to manage websites and content, then ATAG is also relevant.</p>
		<p>Find out more at <a href="/WAI/intro/atag">ATAG Overview</a>.</p>

		<h3>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</h3>
		<p>User agents are software that display web content. For example, web browsers, media players, and some assistive technologies that process and present web content to users.</p>
		<p>UAAG is applicable when additional plug-ins, such as media players, are provided to deliver content or when custom controls are developed to provide non-standard functionality. Where mobile applications deliver web content as part of the application, UAAG may also be relevant. If your organization provides browsers for staff, then UAAG may be relevant as part of the procurement process.</p>
		<p>Find out more at <a href="/WAI/intro/uaag">UAAG Overview</a>.</p>

		<h3>Referencing Approaches</h3>
		<p>As technologies and standards continually evolve, it is important to keep policies current. Including accessibility requirements within the text of policies causes them to become outdated more quickly, and introduce gaps between current accessibility standards and older policies. Ideally a policy would reference the W3C/WAI standards, and define a mechanism to transition to newer versions of the standards when they become available.</p>
		<p>Referencing options are explained in <a href="/WAI/intro/linking#trs">Referencing Guidelines and Other Technical Specifications</a>.</p>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

		<h2 id="conformance">Define conformance levels</h2>
		<p>W3C WAI guidelines provide three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. The generally accepted level of conformance in many countries is Level AA. Selecting a conformance level that is realistically achievable for your particular organization is critical for the success of your policy.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>For each referenced standard, specify what level of conformance is to be achieved.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<h4>Simple example of referencing WCAG</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>ACME Inc. seeks to make sure our website conforms to <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <a href="/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr></a> 2.0 Level AA.</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Example of reference to WCAG and ATAG</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>At ACME Inc. we seek to ensure all of our websites and web applications, both customer-facing and for internal use, conform to all Level AA success criteria of <abbr title="Worldwide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <a href="/TR/WCAG20/"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0</a>. We also aim to ensure that our authoring tools conform to all Level AA criteria of <a href="/TR/ATAG20/"><abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr></a>.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

		<h2 id="scope">Define scope of policy</h2>
		<p>State clearly in your policy how it applies to the different parts of your websites, including any third-party content. For example, you might need to differentiate between newly developed and legacy content, or between intranet and external websites.</p>

		<p>Note that there may be dependencies between the different areas that impact the overall accessibility. For example, the use of third-party content may be essential to complete basic tasks on your website, such as to purchase products and provide credit card information. Websites need to be considered in their entirety, including all its services and applications, including for mobile.</p>

		<p>The scope of accessibility policies can also include the tools used to produce the web content. This can help you achieve better website accessibility and better support staff with disabilities. Considering the browsers and other tools used within your organization can help address organizational accessibility issues.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Clear list of web content the policy will cover.</li>
			<li>List of web content provided internally that will be covered by the policy.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Legal requirements and considerations, for example for public websites and services or for access to workplace.</li>
			<li>Where you have legacy content, consider how the policy covers new, updated, and existing content.</li>
			<li>Internal tools and browsers can impact both the accessibility of created content and the ability of staff with disabilities to do their job.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<h4>Simple example of content scope</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing web content on http://www.acme.inc/ and all content provided internally at http://intranet.acme.inc/.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

		<h2 id="milestones">Set conformance milestones</h2>
		<p>For all items in scope, define a date by which it will meet the policy. If the policy is already achieved, then indicate when the content was last reviewed. Deadlines should be realistic but issues should not be left too long.</p>
		<p>In some cases, a phased approach might be appropriate by first quickly fixing significant accessibility barriers, then implementing fixes for other issues, for example, as part of a planned maintenance update. Clearly outline any details of this type of approach in your policy.</p>
		<p>Information on factors to consider when prioritizing issues is available in <a href="/WAI/impl/improving#prioritize">Improving the Accessibility of Your Website</a>.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Dates for when the policy goals will be met.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider whether to define a staged approach to fix significant accessibility barriers more quickly.</li>
			<li>Consider prioritizing important features and functions.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<h4>Simple example of conformance milestone</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>By February 1, 20XX, ACME Inc's web content will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level AA conformance.</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Example of staged conformance milestones</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>By November 1, 20XX, ACME Inc's websites will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level A conformance; and by May 1, 20XX web content will meet <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0, Level AA conformance.</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Example of supplier milestone</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>By June 1, 20XX, all vendors of content management systems (CMS) used by ACME Inc's should provide information regarding their plans for <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> 2.0 conformance in future versions of their software. By June 1, 2016 ACME Inc. will preferentially purchase <abbr title="Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines">ATAG</abbr> conformant authoring tools.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

		<h2 id="thirdparty">Consider third-party content</h2>
		<p>Procured or syndicated third-party content needs to be considered as part of your accessibility policy. This is particularly relevant for third-party content that provides essential parts of a website. For example, this could include credit card payment services, video streaming channels, or online mapping services.</p>
		<p>While website owners may not have full control over such content and services, they are responsible for ensuring accessibility or for providing accessible alternatives. For example, social media feeds may need to be monitored or moderated to ensure accessibility. See also the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#cc3">WCAG 2.0 Conformance Requirement for "Complete processes"</a>.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify what third-party content is covered and to what conformance level.</li>
			<li>Process for maintaining the accessibility of syndicated content.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other considerations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider including accessibility standards and conformance levels as procurement requirements.</li>
			<li>Consider what procurement verification tasks to include to ensure standards are met.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<h4>Example including third-party content scope</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>This policy applies to all web content produced or updated by ACME Inc. In addition, ACME Inc. will ensure third-party content providers are aware of our web accessibility policy. ACME Inc. will also favor providers based on their accessibility conformance claims.</p> 
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="monitor">Define monitoring and review process</h2>
		<p>Progress towards policy goals should be reviewed regularly. Any changes in timescale or milestones that have been met should be updated in the policy.</p>
		<p>Specify a recommended process and schedule for reviewing all web content and tools in scope to ensure that the target level of accessibility is maintained.</p>
		<p>Capturing feedback from users who might find accessibility barriers can help you identify issues that need to be fixed. Your policy should include information on what mechanisms will be included and how feedback is to be handled and responded to.</p>

		<h3>What to include</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Specify a regular review period and process.</li>
			<li>Outline how user feedback will be captured, responded to, and used.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<h4>Example simple review policy</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>All areas of the ACME Inc. website will be reviewed annually using the process described at <a href="/TR/WCAG-EM/">Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology</a>. Reviews are the responsibility of the ICT department. Accessibility checks will be incorporated into the publishing workflow for all new content.</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Example of feedback policy</h4>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>Each page of the website will include a link to a form allowing users to submit feedback on the site; this information will be compiled and considered during the review process. Any submitted feedback will be responded to within 48 hours.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="examples">Example policies</h2>
		<h3>Example of simple policy</h3>
		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p>ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring the accessibility of its web content to people with disabilities. All of the content on our website will meet W3C WAI's <a href="/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> 2.0, Level AA conformance. Any issues should be reported to <a href="mailto:accessibility@acme.inc">accessibility@acme.inc</a>.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Comprehensive policies</h3>
		<p>More comprehensive policies may capture broader information, such as how the policy might be implemented, who or what departments are responsible, specific exclusions.</p>
		<p>An <a href="examplepolicy">example comprehensive policy</a> is provided.</p>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="template">Policy template</h2>

		<p>In the template below, the <span class="hint">[hints]</span> in brackets are sections for you to complete.</p>

		<div class="drop-shadow">
			<p><span class="hint">[Organization name]</span> is committed to ensuring accessibility of its website and intranet to people with disabilities. New and updated web content produced by our organization will meet <span class="hint">[link to standard]</span> <span class="hint">[version number]</span>, <span class="hint">[level of conformance]</span>, by <span class="hint">[compliance date]</span>.</p>
			<p>Existing web content produced by our organization will meet our standard by <span class="hint">[existing content compliance date]</span>.</p>
			<p>Content provided for our site by third-party developers will meet <span class="hint">[third-party content standard]</span> <span class="hint">[version number]</span> by <span class="hint">[third-party content compliance date]</span>. This <span class="hint">[does/does not]</span> include user-generated content.</p>
			<p>We aim to ensure that our authoring tools and processes meet <span class="hint">[authoring tools standard]</span> <span class="hint">[version number]</span> by <span class="hint">[authoring tools compliance date]</span>. By <span class="hint">[preferential purchasing date]</span> we will preferentially purchase authoring tools that meet or exceed our web accessibility policy.</p>
			<p>This policy will be reviewed <span class="hint">[review period]</span> on or before the <span class="hint">[policy review date]</span>. This policy was last reviewed on <span class="hint">[last review date]</span>, by <span class="hint">[reviewer]</span>.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


		<h2 id="maintain">Next steps: Maintaining your policy</h2>
		<p>If your policy includes milestones and references to particular standards by version number, then review the policy regularly to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date. Any review should check if milestones have been met, as well as checking if any changes are required due to new or updated standards.</p>
		<p>Consider whether the scope of your policy needs to be adjusted due to new content or significant changes to the structure of your website. Changes in authoring tools or processes may also need to be thought about.</p>
		
		<h3>What to consider</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify who is responsible for maintaining the policy.</li>
			<li>Specify a regular review period.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

		
	  <h2 id="strategic">Long term: Strategic planning</h2>
		<p>An accessibility policy is one part of a broader strategic approach to accessibility. Making accessibility an integral part of your web development strategy is more cost effective and efficient than considering it in isolation. There are several things you can do to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard.</p>

		<p><a href="Overview">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a> outlines how to integrate accessibility throughout your web development. Ensure that when redesigns or updates are planned, accessibility is included from the start of the project. Accessibility is much less costly and time-consuming when tackled at the beginning of a project, rather than the end.</p>
		
		<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>

	  <h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
		<p>Key part is to define your terms. Important to developing scope. Important to clarifying policy. Important for people to understand what the policy relates to. [Important for anything else?] [Should this be at the top of the page ... leads into the 'Reference standards' section more readily? Should probably be linked to relevant terms.]</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Web content</dt>
			<dd>Does it include mobile? Does it include third-party? Are there PDF's on your website? Are they important? Why is it all relevant? Are there exceptions? Is it clear the significance of having exceptions?</dd>
			<dt>User agent</dt>
			<dd>Browsers, mobile apps, desktop apps that display web content (thinking iTunes, but other examples may be better). Different standards are relevant.</dd>
