			<h2 id="intro" class="no-display">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Incorporating accessibility into your project or organization is as straight forward as any other planning task. This document provides you with guidance, questions, and a framework for how to approach planning for accessibility. Your actual approach will vary depending the size of your organization, what you are aiming to achieve, and where you are in the development process.</p>
			<p>Additional guidance is available if you are looking at <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/improving.html">Improving the Accessibility of Your Website</a>.</p>
			<p>This document is for project managers, project team leaders, and small business owners. It is also useful for accessibility consultants who are engaged in supporting a project or broader organizational change.</p>
			<p>The following summarizes what this document presents. This does not suggest a fixed order and can be used however best suits your project and organization.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#goals">Determine Goal and Promote Awareness</a> - identifies important themes to address regarding organizational awareness and internal support for accessibility.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			<h2 id="goal">Determine Goal and Promote Awareness</h2>
			<p>Consider your organization's current approach, understanding, and view of accessibility. Ensure buy-in from your organization to help in securing budget and time for accessibility activities. Undertake activities to convince stakeholders or executives of the value of an accessibility lead approach.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Determine and document organizational or project driver for accessibility.</li>
				<li>Identify and document the project goal with regards to accessibility.</li>
				<li>Explore the limitations of your influence to enact change or extract budget.</li>
				<li>Ensure stakeholder support for the goal.</li>
				<li>If required, prepare a business case to secure stakeholder backing.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Discussion</h3>

			<h4 class="f_panelHead">Driver for accessibility</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Understanding why you and your organization are seeking to incorporate accessibility can be important when there are clashes in project or organizational priorities. It also helps you to identify activities important to the success of the project. For example, if senior management have indicated that all new websites must be accessible, then regular reports of accessibility will be required to allow them to plan any additional resourcing needs and communications. If you are responding to national legislation it may be beneficial to convince your project team and stakeholders that accessibility is more than a legal burden to encourage proactive and enthusiastic problem solving.</p>
				<p>Record the rationale for accessibility as part of the broader scope of your planning. This makes sure that everyone is clear why accessibility is important within this particular project. It also ensures that any further developments to the website include the same accessibility considerations.</p>
			</div>

			<h4 class="f_panelHead">Identify your goal</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Knowing what you are aiming to achieve helps you make decisions about what activities are necessary and appropriate. It could be that you are seeking to bring about more accessibility thinking within all aspects of your organization. Perhaps you are a project manager seeking to understand what activities and questions are important to plan for when creating a new accessible web service. Or you may be part of a small organization seeking to ensure that the new website you are commissioning is as accessible as possible.</p>
				<p>For example, if you are seeking to bring about organizational change then there will be a need to plan broader activities such as reviewing purchasing procedures, recruitment criteria, and training provision. If your goal is only to create a WCAG 2.0 AA compliant website then it will be important to undertake an audit, to these guidelines, supported by testing with users.</p>
				<p>As with the driver for accessibility, record the goal in the scope of your planning.</p>
			</div>

			<h4 class="f_panelHead">Organizational influence</h4>
			<div>
				<p>What influence you have within your organization is a significant factor in what can be achieved. As project manager you many not have much influence, but you may have the banking of senior management who see your activities as the first steps in organizational change. In this case you will need to consider what upward reporting is required and how to manage project legacy, such as changes in organizational design guidelines, procurement processes, and content management processes.</p>
				<p>It could also be that your organization has not yet embraced accessibility and you are keen to promote the value of such an approach. In this case activities such as setting out a business case to stakeholders will be of importance, particularly if there is a need to secure additional project funds.</p>
			</div>

			<h4 class="f_panelHead">Promote Awareness</h4>
			<div>
				<p>Stakeholder and executive support and awareness is an extremely important part in achieving your aims. Required promotional activities will depend on your driver for accessibility and what influence you have with stakeholders. The ideal situation is that the driver is concrete and accepted, for example, national legislation, and the executive level of the organization is actively backing accessibility. In this case it may be sufficient to identify the necessary activities and incorporate within the project budget.</p>
				<p>More likely there are factors that will limit what can be done at the project level. In this case there may be a need to begin by creating a business case for accessibility and actively promoting it with the stakeholders and executives. The aim is to encourage budget controllers to be responsive to extending project budget for accessibility related activities.</p>
				<p>Depending on your goal, it may also be necessary to promote accessibility more broadly within the organization. This is particularly important where the goal is to affect change for subsequent projects. This may require presentations and information being made available to people and departments beyond the project team and immediate stakeholders.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>		


			<h2 id="resp">Establish Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
			<p>Identify and appoint individuals who are responsible for accessibility within your project team or organization, and outline what that role entails.</p>
		
			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify roles and assign responsibilities across different areas of the project, such as design, content creation, development, and quality assurance.</li>
				<li>Consider what organizational areas might impact on the accessibility of the project, such as human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, legal, and ensure they are aware of their role and responsibilities.</li>
				<li>Communicate up and down within the project and organization who the responsible parties are.</li>
				<li>If you are using an external company or organization, ensure that they are aware of your accessibility requirements and of their responsibilities.</li>
				<li>For websites and projects spanning multiple jurisdictional regions, ensure that responsibility is assigned for each region.</li>
			</ul>


			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<div class="">
					<p>Identifying and appointing individuals responsible for accessibility is an important part of ensuring that accessibility is considered throughout the design and development process, and across the organization. The assigned roles ensure that any accessibility related issues are not neglected and that everyone on the team knows where to take accessibility questions.</p>

					<div class="aside">
						<p class="eg">
							e.g.
						</p>
						<div class="example-bar">
							<h4>Example responsibilities</span></h4>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Marketing</b> - Ensuring good accessibility practice within the brand or design guidelines.</li>
								<li><b>Quality assurance</b> - Test for and track accessibility issues within the code.</li>
								<li><b>Development</b> - Maintain code libraries with accessible components.</li>
								<li><b>Purchasing</b> - Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes.</li>
								<li><b>Acceptance testing</b> - Ensure that any agency delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility.</li>
								<li><b>Recruitment</b> - Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>Responsibility may be spread throughout your project team, particularly in larger teams. For example, the responsibility for ensuring accessible visual design may be shared by the design manager and digital designer. In other situations, one individual may have multiple responsibilities. For example, in a smaller team a developer may be responsible for the coding as well as for the quality assurance testing. What is important, is to identify the necessary responsibilities and assign them to appropriate individuals.</p>
					<p>While some roles and responsibilities are focused on the immediate project needs, others are focused on ensuring sustainability of the necessary frameworks that facilitate accessibility. For example, part of the responsibility of the role for 'accessible design' would be to ensure that members of the design team have the appropriate skills and knowledge to deliver accessible designs. Other areas that you may also need to consider include human resources, procurement, marketing, organizational executive, and legal. Identified responsible parties in these areas have the task of incorporating accessibility into existing policies, practices, and procedures.</p> 
					<p>For some organizations the task of creating a website, or part of it, such as the visual design, is often placed in the hands of an external company. In this case you, as the purchaser, will still hold responsibility for website accessibility. It is important to ensure that you are clearly communicating what you expect in terms of accessibility to the supplier.</p>
					<p>The following list provides examples of other functions that might be important to consider when assigning responsibility:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sign-off process and authority for accessibility of deliverables.</li>
						<li>Manage and procure accessibility audits and testing.</li>
						<li>Executive presentations of progress and business value of accessibility.</li>
						<li>Regular communication between regional and departmental accessibility teams.</li>
						<li>Ongoing review and sharing of new accessibility techniques.</li>
						<li>Identify and respond to accessibility training needs.</li>
					</ul>

			<h2 id="policy">Develop and Implement Accessibility Policy</h2>
			<p>Create or review your organizational or project accessibility policy. This outlines your commitment to accessibility, relevant standards or legislation, and contact information. There is likely to be an internal and external version of this document.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and review any existing policy.</li>
				<li>Establish an organizational policy on web accessibility.</li>
				<li>Communicate organizational policy.</li>
				<li>Review policies and procedures to incorporate organizational policy.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Your organizational policy captures and communicates your intentions to create accessible websites and services. <a href="pol.html">Developing Organizational Policies</a> provides information on how to develop your policy, this discussion concentrates on what the policy is for and what to do with it.</p>
				
				<h4>Existing policy</h4>
				<p>An organizational policy may already exist or there may be a general statement on website accessibility conformance. In larger organizations other departments, such as online development teams, corporate social responsibility, and user experience, may be developing or have developed accessibility policies. If such a policy exists it may support your accessibility goals or might not encompass everything you are hoping to achieve. In either case it is worth asking some questions. How is the policy implemented? Are there any issues implementing it? Is it up to date?</p>
				
				<h4>Communicating your policy</h4>
				<p>Making people, both internal and external, aware of the existence of your policy is an important step in acknowledging your intent. Communication is also important for subsequent projects. The more the policy is promoted, the greater the awareness of it within your organization. For external audiences you may need a policy written in a non-technical way, without reference to internal departments or processes. Internal audiences will require more information regarding responsible parties, contacts, and on the technical elements of website accessibility. It may also be beneficial to provide a facility and policy for readers to feedback with compliments or concerns.</p>
				
				<h4>Updating processes and procedures</h4>
				<p>Where your goals have an element of organizational change there will be a need to explore how the policy is incorporated into other organizational processes and procedures. For example, your procurement processes would outline how externally purchased websites or elements will meet your accessibility policy and what acceptance criteria are acceptable. Policy and procedural review can be an extensive activity that may form a project by itself.</p>

				<h4>Smaller organizations</h4>
				<p>For smaller organizations the policy may be a simple statement of intent and reference to WCAG 2.0 as an appropriate international standard. Communicating this may only require publishing it on your website and ensuring the organization is aware of it. </p>
			</div>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="resource">Review Available Tools and Resources</h2>
			<p>Identify and review what internal design and development resources are available and how they already support the project goals and accessibility policy. Resources could include design guidelines, templates, coding standards, coding libraries, content management systems, and content strategies. You may also be able to research common practices in other organizational websites to identify common accessible solutions and barriers.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and review authoring tools.</li>
				<li>Locate and review any accessibility evaluations of existing websites or online services.</li>
				<li>Review any brand or design guidelines.</li>
				<li>Review any coding libraries or standards.</li>
				<li>Assign staff to address any identified issues with organizational shared tools and resources.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>When planning the creation of a new website you will need to consider what standard organizational resources are available and how accessible these are. If you are looking to improve organization wide accessibility, reviewing and improving resources that all projects use is a great way to bring about extensive change.</p>
				
				<h4>Existing websites</h4>
				<p>For some organizations there may already be many websites or services. If planning for a new website within a similar framework or style then understanding what solutions and problems currently exist will be useful. For organizational change evaluating existing websites will be an important starting point in understanding the extent of work required to address online accessibility issues. If accessibility evaluations or research already exist then using them will be more cost effective than commissioning new ones. It is important in this case to ensure that the evaluation was performed to a similar standard as any new or updated accessibility policy.</p>
				
				<h4>Authoring tools</h4>
				<p>The most commonly known authoring tool is the Content Management System (CMS) but there may be other authoring tools used in creating content for your website. For example, the creation of <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> documents will involve a number of tools or a defined process. These tools and processes need to be reviewed in order to ensure that the final document is accessible.</p>
				<p>Most websites are managed via some form of <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>. This allows content managers to organize, edit and publish website content. There are two aspects of the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that need to be reviewed: how accessible is the tool itself, and how does the tool help promote the creation of more accessible content. The former is important for any staff members with disabilities who create content for the website.</p>
				<p>You may find that your organization subscribes to a particular <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that has known accessibility barriers that are beyond the scope of your project. Reporting these issues to the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> provider is important in order to encourage them to produce accessible solutions. How you resolve these issues in your project largely depends on the nature of the issue. For issues concerned with how the <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> supports users with disabilities, additional training or changes in processes might be required. For issues that result in the create of inaccessible components your development team could create bespoke solutions that mitigate the issue.</p>
				<p>Any video production process can also be reviewed in order to ensure that the final video content is produced in a manner as to promote accessibility. For example, does the process account for the time to create the transcript and captions?</p>

				<h4>Design guidelines and coding libraries</h4>
				<p>Your organization may have design or branding guidelines, content guidelines, or may have standard coding libraries or guidelines for online services. Ideally when all these assets were created they were assessed for accessibility. If this is not the case and these resources must be used in your project, then it will benefit you to assess them for accessibility. Reviewing shared resources such as these will have a broad reaching benefit in your organization as any subsequent projects will benefit from the improved accessibility in core resources.</p>
				
				<h4>Planning for reviews and resolutions</h4>
				<p>If there is a need to review existing websites, organizational resources, authoring tools, or even previous evaluations, then this will need to be factored in early in the project plan to allow findings to be addressed in a timely fashion.</p>
				<p>For organizational resources, such as design guidelines, it is likely that there is an involved sign off process to follow when changes are requested. Identifying and communicating with the owner of these resources will allow you to understand any constraints. This is also an opportunity to obtain additional budget or staff as maintenance and improvement of the resource may fall within another departmental remit.</p>
				<p>Finally, you will also need to ensure that any findings and action are captured in a way that they will available during the appropriate phase of the project.</p>
				<p>The section on <a href="#project">Project Life Cycle</a> discusses the evaluation activities in slightly more depth.</p>

			</ul>

			<p class="totop"><a href="#contents">back to page contents</a></p>


			<h2 id="train">Assess Skills and Training</h2>
			<p>Assess expertise and motivation of design, development and content personnel. Identify and plan for training key personnel within the project or organization. Secure external training resources to create and/or deliver training options. Consider what additional recruitment needs might be required and how recruitment might change to respond to your organizational policy.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify key personnel responsible for the design, development, and content for the project.</li>
				<li>Evaluate motivation and understanding of accessibility issues.</li>
				<li>Evaluate accessibility expertise.</li>
				<li>Budget and plan in training for team members. </li>
				<li>If recruitment is necessary, ensure recruitment briefs include accessibility requirements.</li>
				<li>If seeking organizational change, review and update recruitment criteria.</li>
				<li>If using external suppliers, evaluate their ability to provide accessible solutions</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>The ability to create an accessible website is larger dependent on the skills and expertise of the team of designers, developers, and content creators. A frequent cause of accessibility barriers is simply the lack of awareness of the subject. The aim is to develop a better understanding of the need and value of accessibility, as well as improving the skills of key personnel.</p>
				
				<h4>Identify personnel</h4>
				<p>For contained projects it is likely that your project team will be the only individuals that require assessment and, possibly, training. Where your remit is more organization wide those personnel involved with website creation and management will need to be identified. These people are likely to be part of many different departments such as marketing, design, IT, and customer support.</p>
				<p>If there is a need to recruit additional personnel for the project, then accessibility awareness and expertise can be included into the recruitment brief. New recruits can be an important resource in quickly developing internal accessibility expertise. For larger teams there will be key personnel who have specific responsibility for accessibility, although all team members will need a good general awareness.</p>

				<h4>Evaluate awareness</h4>
				<p>Once you have identified important personnel, you will need to carry out an initial evaluation of their motivation for and understanding of accessibility. This can be achieved using surveys or interviews. Knowing this information will allow you to plan activities designed to address misconceptions and build understanding. This is important when changing broad organizational attitudes towards accessibility and developing awareness as to why it is important. Where there is a more contained project team it is valuable to know what personnel consider to be accessibility to be and what specific gaps in understanding might exist. Knowing this helps developing training resources designed to improve awareness and appreciation of the issues.</p>
				
				<h4>Evaluate expertise</h4>
				<p>Technical, design, and content creation staff will need to have both a good awareness of the need for accessible solutions and the technical expertise to deliver accessible solutions. Self-reporting of skills in this area can be adequate for an initial assessment. Again, the aim is to understand what training will be required.</p>
				
				<h4>External suppliers</h4>
				<p>When using external suppliers for any aspect of website creation it is important to know that they are experienced in delivering accessible solutions. Ensure that you request credentials in this area and ideally check a sample of their deliverables.</p>
				
				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>Once you have identified who requires additional training you will need to develop or otherwise source the appropriate training. There is help and information on <a href="/WAI/training/Overview.html">how to structure training</a> materials. What you need in terms of training depends largely on your goals, the organizational and team awareness, and the expertise in the team. Example training sessions might include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Introduction to accessibility</li>
					<li>Benefits of accessible websites</li>
					<li>Writing accessible content</li>
					<li>Visual design and accessibility</li>
					<li>Accessible web development</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you have experienced accessibility professionals internally then they may be able to develop the required resources, possibly in collaboration with your training or HR teams.</p>
				<p>Beyond the scope of the current project there will be a need to ensure that any new staff are appropriately trained in accessibility. This may require the inclusion of an introductory course as part of employee induction. Members of staff who have more direct responsibility for implementing accessible solutions can be provided with access to more extensive training options.</p>

				<p>Starting early with accessibility increases the positive impact your work will have for target audiences, reduces the associated costs, and increases the adoption of accessible design and coding features. Aiming to include accessibility into your existing web project process helps to increase adoption and reduce additional costs. For example, instead of evaluating accessibility separately, integrate accessibility checks iteratively within your current testing and <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> processes.</p>
				
				<h4>Design and content</h4>

				<h5>Key actions</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Review designs at wireframe or mock-up stage.</li>
					<li>Review any prepared style guide.</li>
					<li>Review content, including navigation terminology, and content presentation.</li>
					<li>Factor in a number of iterations of design reviews.</li>
					<li>Seek input from users with disabilities.</li>
					<li>Run whole team accessibility review of designs.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The graphic and user interface design of web pages can be subjected to early checks against a number of accessibility criteria. It is possible to review color palette, font usage, and interaction designs. Having an awareness of accessibility allows your designers to ensure that they are not inadvertently introducing avoidable issues. Working closely with developers with accessibility experience can allow your design team to explore their designs and how slight changes might help the accessibility of the final code.</p>
				<p>Content production may be considered as part of the design activities or as a separate work stream. Content that is easily understood and accessible to persons with disabilities can be assessed at an early stage. How the content is to be presented, in terms of font, color, spacing, and width, are also important aspects that can be evaluated.</p>
				<p>Depending on the size of the site your design phase may also include an exploration of navigation structure and terminology. As navigation serves a key part in helping people find content, it is important to ensure that the terminology is clear, understandable, and descriptive.</p>
				<p>Fixing accessibility issues as this stage is relatively easy and inexpensive. The more time spent ensuring that your designs have considered accessibility, the less risk there is that subsequent stages will introduce barriers.</p>

				<h4>Development</h4>

				<h5>Key actions</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Perform informal <a href="/WAI/eval/preliminary.html">Easy Checks</a> of pages, modules and sections.</li>
					<li>Perform formal evaluations at key project milestones.</li>
					<li>Provide a checklist of applicable criteria and relevant techniques.</li>
					<li>Seek input from users with disabilities.</li>
					<li>Create and manage a repository of best practice solutions.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The development cycle is most often the key focus when considering accessibility. As with design, starting early in the phase is key to a successful outcome. Including development knowledge at the design stage can help developers understand designer goals and how designs might be modified in slight ways to improve final code accessibility.</p>
				<p>Consider developing a checklist of key accessibility points to review during development. The checklist need not be exhaustive, but should aim to cover the most important points. Also beneficial is a list of easy checks for web accessibility and providing the tools in order for developers to perform the necessary checks. Also useful to developers is a checklist of important and relevant techniques to follow based on the technology being used. For example, a list of <a href="/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/html.html">all available HTML techniques</a>.</p>
				<p>Note that a checklist is not a replacement for a comprehensive formal evaluation.</p>
				<p>As at the design stage, seeking input from users with disabilities is extremely important and helpful, especially where new features are developed. As development is ongoing this need not be a formal evaluation with users but can be spot checks on key features where the accessibility is unclear or when a particular page or group of pages is complete.</p>
				<p>As the project progresses new accessible techniques and solutions will be engineered that may be beneficial to record for future projects. This may also be important for the current project if the techniques can be used elsewhere. This may be part of ongoing <a href="#share">sharing activities</a> for broader organizational changes.</p>
				
				<h4>Quality Assurance</h4>

				<h5>Key actions</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Perform a comprehensive evaluation of the complete website.</li>
					<li>Run testing with users with disabilities on the complete website.</li>
					<li>Where possible, team members should observe testing sessions.</li>
					<li>Assess identified barriers and explore solutions with the whole team.</li>
					<li>Plan for a reasonable gap between completion and go live to address any final barriers.</li>
					<li>Include final results into organizational reporting.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Evaluation may be closely integrated with your development process or may be a discrete project stage. In either case there is a need to ensure that what has been created meets your organizational policy. The main activity at this stage is likely to be a full comprehensive audit and testing of the complete website with users with disabilities.</p>
				<p>Following audit and testing there is likely to be a need to have developer time available to address any barriers that still exist before go-line. Any barriers should be reviewed with the full project team to identify accessible solutions that meet the needs of all project stakeholders. Ideally any solutions would be evaluated with users to ensure that they adequately address the identified barrier.</p>
				<p>The more accessibility evaluation done in the early stages and throughout development the less likely there is the need for final fixes and rework. If the only evaluation that takes place is scheduled just prior to go-live, there is a significant risk that barriers will exist and that the cost to fix them will prohibit an accessible solution being available.</p>
				<p>Depending on the goals of the project any final report may need to be prepared for delivery to stakeholders and executives. There may also be a need to standardize the results for inclusion in organization wide reporting metrics.</p>

			<h2 id="share">Share Knowledge and Outcomes</h2>
			<p>Consider how the project success or difficulties need to be feed to stakeholders, the wider organization and the website audiences. Plan for ongoing issue tracking of website, organizational assets, such as design guidelines, and policies and procedures.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Report to stakeholders the project accessibility successes and difficulties.</li>
				<li>Create internal publicity for new website accessibility.</li>
				<li>If considering the whole organization, create a monitoring and reporting framework.</li>
				<li>Consider how to capture and share information on new technologies and techniques.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Sharing what is learned as part of a project is key to ongoing improvements in accessibility. Keeping executives, stakeholders, key departments, and the broader organization informed increases organizational awareness but also ensures that there is practical knowledge available for subsequent projects.</p>
				
				<h4>Upward reporting and metrics</h4>
				<p>Keeping management aware of accessibility progress may be an important consideration for your project. To do this you will need to think about the best way to keep them informed and what information they will find useful. Part of this involves having a clear understanding of why accessibility is important to them. For example, if they are concerned with legal compliance issues then it is important to report on how well websites conform with your organizational policy. If their primary concern is corporate social responsibility then they may be interested in PR activities, publicity, and impact on brand.</p>
				<p>Where the project goal is organizationally broad, there will likely be a need to create a standard recording and reporting template. This will allow for comparison both across websites and between different website releases. This is useful for highlighting trends and identifying common points of failure.</p>
				
				<h4>Keeping your organization informed</h4>
				<p>Beyond keeping stakeholders and executives informed there may be a need to keep all staff aware of any accessibility issues and information. For many members of staff this will be general information on what the organization has achieved. For some, for example, website development teams, design teams, content creators, customer support, the information is more useful on a day-to-day basis.</p>
				<p>Sharing with the general members of staff need not be overly technical and can concentrate on the value that an accessible approach brings, who benefits and how.</p>
				<p>Providing a knowledge management platform to host best practice guidelines, technical techniques, policies and procedures, may be an important requirement. For individuals with responsibility for accessibility this ensure there is a shared communication platform, which may be especially important if the individuals are geographically spread. A knowledge management resource helps avoid repeating problems and in spreading best practice solutions. As knowledge of accessibility percolates through your organization, having a known platform for communicating this information can be invaluable as teams will come to see it as a go-to resource when developing websites.</p>

			<h2 id="monitor">Maintain and Monitor</h2>
			<p>Plan for regular content reviews and ensure the accessibility policy is incorporated into maintenance activities. Provide an appropriate feedback mechanism for users with accessibility issues.</p>

			<h3>Key actions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a plan for regular checks and audits.</li>
				<li>Review and update publication process to include accessibility checks.</li>
				<li>Implement a feedback process for accessibility issues.</li>
				<li>Schedule regular reviews and updates of policies and processes.</li>
				<li>Plan for reviews of organizational assets related to website creation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="f_panelHead">Discussion</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Monitoring website accessibility is important to ensure that all the good work involved in creating the website is not undermined. For organizations with many websites and services an effective monitoring process is an important part of broader accessibility efforts.</p>
				
				<h4>Regular checks</h4>
				<p>Your organization's websites or any website being planned will most likely include content that is regularly updated and added to. In order to ensure that high quality accessible content is maintained, there is a need to plan for regular checks of a random sample of content. Even better, if your organization has a publication process with a <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> phase, then accessibility checks can be added to ensure nothing is published that does not meet your accessibility policy. The extent of the checks that need to be performed in this way are likely to be less extensive as most authoring tools limit content creators ability to add arbitrary HTML.</p>
				<p>As well as indicating when checks will take place, any maintenance and monitoring plan needs to be clear as to who is responsible for the checks. The plan should also include an escalation path for those issues that cannot be addressed via the authoring tools.</p>
				<p>The aim of the checks is both to address any accessibility issues that might slip into the content but also to identify any additional training needs. If the same issue is consistently occurring, basic training can be improved to ensure that it is covered. If specific individuals are more frequently introducing accessibility issues, then specific additional training can be arranged.</p>

				<h4>Feedback mechanisms</h4>
				<p>In order to ensure that your website remains as accessible as possible it is important to ensure that there is a mechanism in place to allow you to gather and respond to user feedback. There needs to be a clear and simple way for users to raise issues. This could be part of the broader customer support activities or a specific email address.</p>
				<p>Whoever is responsible for responding to these queries will need to be appropriately trained. They will need to appreciate the issues and understand the process for escalating issues to the appropriate responsible individual. Where it is not possible to address an issue immediately, there needs to be an appropriate process in place to feed this into the next maintenance release.</p>

				<h4>Updating policies and processes</h4>
				<p>Following the completion of any website project there is an opportunity to review organizational policies and procedures and update them based on how they supported accessible website creation. Policies and procedures can also be revised and improved based on internal or external feedback.</p>
				<p>For example, it may be that your policy says little regarding what is required of video transcripts and visitor feedback consistently points to problems in this area. This could be addressed by improving the internal guidelines and review process for videos to include better instruction on what is required for transcripts.</p>
				<p>Policies and procedures will also benefit from regular reviews against new or updated legislation, standards or best practice. As with regular website checks this needs to be planned for and appropriate responsible individuals assigned the task of completing the review. For changes in practices it may be more beneficial to enable those tasked with creating and maintaining websites to note and discuss new technologies and techniques.</p>
